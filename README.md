# 📝 Product Review Sentiment Analysis

A machine learning project that classifies product review sentiments into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using natural language processing and supervised learning. It includes a fully functional **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project builds a sentiment analysis pipeline with:

- **TF-IDF** vectorization
- **SMOTE** to address class imbalance
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier
- **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning
- **Streamlit** web app for interactive sentiment predictions

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Accurate Sentiment Classification**  
✅ **Advanced Text Preprocessing** (lowercasing, lemmatization, stopwords removal)  
✅ **Handles Class Imbalance** with SMOTE  
✅ **Hyperparameter Optimization** using GridSearchCV  
✅ **User-Friendly Streamlit Web App**

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akashprajapaticse/Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis
````

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. (Optional) Download NLTK resources

The scripts will automatically download NLTK data (stopwords, punkt, wordnet) if not available.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔧 Train the Model

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

> This will preprocess data, tune hyperparameters, and save the trained pipeline to `models/sentiment_pipeline.pkl`.

### 🌐 Run the Streamlit Web App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> Your browser will open the app at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📊 Model Performance

* **Accuracy:** \~63%
* **Challenges:** Neutral sentiment is harder to classify due to semantic ambiguity.
* **Strengths:** Performs well for strongly positive or negative reviews.

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

* 🔍 **Better Neutral Classification**
* 🧠 **Use of Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, RoBERTa
* 📈 **Deep Learning Models**: CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs
* 🧪 **Larger and Diverse Datasets**
